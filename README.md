# DevOps Challenge

As a DevOps you should be able to automate the infrastructure and the deployments as much as possible taking care of the metrics and logs. We are trying to understand your skills using the current tools that we are using on the team. 


## First Challenge

Create a GitLab Repository, this repository will contain the application and the server configurations required. For the scope of the test we are going to use a simple Nodejs hello world API.


#### Considerations

- There is not database connection.

## First Challenge

- Dockerize the project. The app needs to work with Docker and docker-compose. 
- The size of the docker image needs to be as small as possible.

## Second Challenge

- The app should run in a Kubernetes cluster, using Helm.
- The cluster creation should be done with Terraform.

## Extra

- Automate the deployment using Gitlab Pipelines 

## Lately

- Document the project with all the necesarry steps in the README.md file


The time estimated for the project is between 3 and 8 hours if you feel that will take more you can cut corners, but that will affect the result of the test. Anyways you still have a complete week to finish the test after you received it.

We are going to give you feedback as fast as possible.

When you finish the project you can send an email
