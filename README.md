# DevOps Challenge

As a DevOps you should be able to automate the infrastructure and the deployments as much as possible taking care of the metrics and logs. We are trying to understand your skills using the current tools that we are using on the team. 


## First Challenge

Create a GitLab Repository, this repository will contain the website and the server configurations required. For the scope of the test we are going to use a monorep.


#### Considerations
- The web should be only a index.html with a simple content to check
- No need of database connectionl

## Second Challenge

Dockerize the project. You small app need to work with Docker and Kubernetes. 

#### Considerations
- The cluster creation should be done with Terraform
- K8s Files need to be in the repository as well with the code 

## Extra

Automate the deployment using Gitlab Pipelines 


## Lately

Document the project with all the necesarry steps in the README.md file


The time estimated for the project is between 3 and 8 hours if you feel that will take more you can cut corners, but that will affect the result of the test. Anyways you still have a complete week to finish the test after you received it.

We are going to give you feedback as fast as possible.


When you finish the project you can send an email to Leonardo leonardo.vidarte@mailmac.net and Pablo pablo.morales@mailmac.net
